## Challenge: Choosing for team B
Can you add code to choose a player at random for team B? You'll need to:

+ Create a new `team_B` list
+ Choose a random player for team B (called `player_B`)
+ `append` the chosen player to your `team_B` list
+ `remove` the chosen player from your list of `players`

The code you'll need for `team_B` will be __very__ similar to the code you've already written for `team_A`!
