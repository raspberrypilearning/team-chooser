## Players

Let's start by creating a list of players to choose from.



Open the [Team chooser starter](https://editor.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/team-chooser-starter){:target="_blank"} project. The code editor will open in another browser tab.

+ You can use a variable to store a __list__ of players. The list should be in square brackets `[ ]`, with a comma between each item in the list. 

	Start by adding a list of players to your program.

+ Add this code to print your `players` variable:

+ You can get to an item in the list by adding its position in square brackets after the variable name.

	The first item in the list is at __position 0__. This is different to Scratch, which starts at position 1.
